# 💬 Simple Forum API with DDD
I developed this project during my latest studies on Node lessons at [Rocketseat](https://www.rocketseat.com.br).

## 🚀 Techs and Tools
- [Node.js v18](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/)

## 🖥️ Project
This project was developed to practice the Domain-Driven Design (DDD) and Clean Architecture in Node.js. It was developed from the core domain, to base entities, to value objects, to relationships, to use cases, to subdomains, to domain events and unit tests.

## ⚙️ Get started
```zsh
npm i
npm run test
```

## 💬 Application
The core domain of this project is used on a NextJS API developed by me, [check it out](https://github.com/rcrdk/forum-with-nodejs-nest-ddd).
